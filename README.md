> The proper orthogonal decomposition (POD), a modal decomposition technique, has been widely used for analyzing the spatial-temporal coherence of wind pressure fields, due to the complex nature of wind-structure interactions. The interpretation of characteristics and information of the extracted modes, however, is influenced by the POD algorithm, which tends to mix multiple temporal frequencies in a single mode. In this study, an operator-theoretic based decomposition approach referred to as the dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) is introduced to characterize aerodynamic pressure fields to offer an additional perspective. More specifically, the proposed approach can capture not only dominant spatial patterns but also identify each pattern with a specific frequency and a corresponding temporal evolution (growth/decay). To demonstrate the unique feature of the proposed decomposition algorithm, this study is directed towards the analysis of fluctuating pressures on bluff bodies immersed in boundary layer flows. In particular, aerodynamic pressure fields over a prism were analyzed using limited wind tunnel data and a comparison with the POD was carried out to observe commonalities and unique perspective of each decomposition. Quantification and interpretation of the decomposition results are provided. It is envisaged that DMD would supplement our understanding of the dynamics of pressure fields currently available via POD.

This work is currently under the review process. Code, models and data will all be released closer to publication.
